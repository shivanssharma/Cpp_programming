#Arithmetic Operators
Addition : a+b
Subtraction : a-b
Multiplication : a*b
Division : a/b
Modulus : a%%b
exponent : a^b
Floor Division : a%/%b

#Relational Operators
Equal To : a==b
Not Equal To : a!=b
Greater Than : a>b
Less Than : a<b
Greater Than Equal To : a>=b
Less Than Equal To : a<=b

#Assignment Operator
##There are two types of Assignment operators : Left and Right

Left assignment : x<-15
Right assignemt : 25->x

hence, 15 < x < 25

#Logical Operator
AND : a&b
OR : a|b
NOT : !a
